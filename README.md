Prompt to Recreate the Streamlit App

I want to create a Streamlit web application called "Character Decomposition Explorer" that allows users to explore Chinese character decompositions using a JSON data file named "strokes1.json". The app should have the exact functionality described below, using the provided data file and displaying specific fields in the order: Pinyin, Strokes, Radical, IDC, Definition, Etymology. Here's the detailed specification:

### Data File
- The data file is `strokes1.json`, containing a list of entries with the following structure for each Chinese character:
  ```json
  {
    "character": str,  // The Chinese character (e.g., "Êú®")
    "strokes": int,   // Number of strokes (e.g., 4)
    "pinyin": str,    // Pinyin pronunciation (e.g., "m√π")
    "definition": str, // English definition (e.g., "tree; wood")
    "radical": str,   // Radical character (e.g., "Êú®")
    "etymology": {
      "hint": str,    // Brief etymology description (e.g., "Pictograph of a tree")
      "details": str  // Detailed etymology (e.g., "Represents a tree with branches")
    },
    "decomposition": str, // Decomposition string (e.g., "‚ø¥ÂõóÊú®" or "Êú®"), where the first character may be an IDC (Ideographic Description Character)
    "compounds": [str]    // List of compound phrases (e.g., ["Êú®Êùê", "Êú®Â§¥"])
  }
IDC characters are: ‚ø∞, ‚ø±, ‚ø≤, ‚ø≥, ‚ø¥, ‚øµ, ‚ø∂, ‚ø∑, ‚ø∏, ‚øπ, ‚ø∫, ‚øª.
A character is valid if it falls in Unicode ranges: ‰∏Ä to Èøø, ‚∫Ä to ‚ªø, „êÄ to ‰∂ø, or †ÄÄ to ™õü.
App Requirements
Purpose:
Allow users to select or type a Chinese character (component) and view all characters that contain it as a component, filtered by user-specified criteria.
Display detailed information for each character in dropdowns and output cards, in the order: Pinyin, Strokes, Radical, IDC, Definition, Etymology.
Support filtering by stroke count, radical, and IDC for input components and output characters.
Include a display mode to show single characters or compound phrases (2, 3, or 4 characters).
UI Layout:
Title: "üß© Character Decomposition Explorer" as an h1 header.
Component Filters Section:
Three dropdowns in a row for filtering input components:
Stroke Count: Options are 0 (No Filter) or unique stroke counts from the data, sorted.
Radical: Options are "No Filter" or unique radicals from filtered components, sorted.
Structure IDC: Options are "No Filter" or IDC characters from filtered components' decompositions, sorted, with descriptions (e.g., "‚ø∞ (Left Right)").
Select Input Component Section:
A dropdown to select a component, showing all filtered components with fields: Pinyin, Strokes, Radical, IDC, Definition, Etymology.
A text input to type a single character, with paste support via JavaScript.
Filter Output Characters Section:
Three controls in a row:
Result IDC: Options are "No Filter" or IDC characters from output characters, sorted.
Result Radical: Options are "No Filter" or radicals from output characters, sorted.
Output Type: Radio buttons for "Single Character", "2-Character Phrases", "3-Character Phrases", "4-Character Phrases".
A "Reset Filters" button, disabled if all filters are default.
Selected Component Card:
Displays the selected component with fields in the specified order.
Output Dropdown:
A dropdown to select an output character, showing all filtered output characters with fields: Pinyin, Strokes, Radical, IDC, Definition, Etymology.
Results Section:
Header: "üß¨ Results for [selected_comp] ‚Äî [count] result(s)".
Character cards for each output character, showing fields in the specified order.
For non-"Single Character" modes, show a compounds section with phrases of the selected length.
Export Compounds:
An expandable section with a text area containing all compound phrases for copying, with JavaScript to auto-copy to clipboard.
Debug Info:
Display the total number of components and radicals (characters where radical equals the character).
An expandable section showing: current text input, selected component, stroke count, radical, IDC, and debug messages.
Functionality:
Component Map:
Build a defaultdict(list) mapping each component to characters containing it, using recursive decomposition up to a max depth of 5.
Include the character itself and all sub-components from its decomposition.
Input Component Selection:
Filter components by stroke count (0 for no filter), radical ("No Filter" or matching radical), and IDC ("No Filter" or matching decomposition start).
Include radicals (e.g., ‰∏Ä, ÂøÉ) in the dropdown.
If no components match filters, show a warning and clear the selection.
Reset selected_comp to the first filtered component if the current selection is invalid.
Support typing a single character, validating it against component_map or char_decomp.
Reset filters if the typed character doesn‚Äôt match current filters.
Output Characters:
List all characters from component_map[selected_comp], filtered by selected_idc and output_radical, but not by component filters (stroke count, radical, component_idc).
For non-"Single Character" modes, only include characters with compounds of the selected length.
Field Display:
Pinyin: From pinyin, default "‚Äî".
Strokes: From strokes as "X strokes", default "unknown strokes" if -1.
Radical: From radical, default "‚Äî".
IDC: First character of decomposition if in IDC_CHARS, else "‚Äî".
Definition: From definition, default "No definition available".
Etymology: Combine etymology.hint and etymology.details (if non-empty) as "hint; Details: details", default "No hint available".
Session State:
Initialize with random defaults for selected_comp (e.g., Áà´, ÂøÉ), stroke_count=0, radical="No Filter", component_idc="No Filter", selected_idc="No Filter", output_radical="No Filter", display_mode (varies).
Track previous_selected_comp, page, results_per_page=50, text_input_comp, debug_info.
Callbacks:
on_text_input_change: Validate input, update selected_comp, reset page.
on_selectbox_change: Update text_input_comp, reset page.
on_output_char_select: Set selected_comp to selected output character, reset page.
on_reset_filters: Reset all filters to default, clear input.
Styling:
Use the following CSS for a clean, responsive design:
.selected-card: Blue border, flex layout, responsive for mobile.
.selected-char: Large red character.
.details: Dark blue text with bold labels.
.results-header: Bold header for results.
.char-card: White card with hover effect.
.compounds-section: Light green background for compounds.
.stContainer, .stButton: Styled containers and buttons.
Media query for mobile adjustments.
Error Handling:
Handle missing or invalid strokes1.json with an error message.
Validate input characters and show warnings for invalid inputs.
Handle empty filtered components with a warning.
Please write a complete Streamlit app (app.py) that meets these requirements, using strokes1.json as the data source. Ensure all dropdowns and output results (selected component card and character cards) display the fields in the order: Pinyin, Strokes, Radical, IDC, Definition, Etymology. Include all necessary imports, functions, and styling to replicate the described functionality.


### Explanation of the Prompt
1. **Data File Specification**:
   - Describes the `strokes1.json` structure explicitly, including all fields and their types, to ensure Grok understands the data source.
   - Lists IDC characters and valid Unicode ranges for character validation.

2. **Detailed Requirements**:
   - Breaks down the app into sections (UI, functionality, styling) to cover all aspects of the current app.
   - Specifies the exact field order (Pinyin; Strokes; Radical; IDC; Definition; Etymology) for dropdowns and output.
   - Details the component map construction, filtering logic, and decoupling of output dropdown from component filters.

3. **UI and Functionality**:
   - Describes each UI component (dropdowns, text input, buttons, cards) with their behavior and styling.
   - Explains filter logic, session state initialization, and callback functions to ensure identical behavior.
   - Includes debug info and export compounds functionality.

4. **Styling and Error Handling**:
   - Provides the exact CSS from the current app for consistency.
   - Specifies error handling for file loading, invalid inputs, and empty filters.

5. **Clarity and Completeness**:
   - The prompt is comprehensive, covering all features of the current app, including minor details like JavaScript for paste events and auto-copy for export.
   - Avoids ambiguity by specifying defaults, validation rules, and field formatting.

### Notes
- **Starting from Scratch**: This prompt assumes you have only `strokes1.json` and want Grok to generate the full `app.py`. It includes enough detail to avoid reliance on prior code.
- **Testing the Prompt**: If you use this prompt, verify the generated code by checking:
  - Radicals like ‰∏Ä and ÂøÉ appear in the input dropdown.
  - All fields display in the correct order in dropdowns and cards.
  - Filters work as expected, and the output dropdown is decoupled from component filters.
  - Debug info shows the correct number of components and radicals.
- **Adjustments**: If Grok generates code with minor issues (e.g., missing a specific filter or styling detail), you can refine the prompt by adding more specific instructions or providing feedback on the output.

If you want to test this prompt or need a modified version (e.g., tailored for a different context or with additional features), let me know, and I can assist further!





Fix Streamlit app where typing a character (e.g., 'Ê†ó') doesn't persist in the input box or sync with the dropdown, and IDC/radical filters need multiple selections to update. Ensure: typing a character shows it in both input box and dropdown, resets component filters (stroke count, radical, IDC), and updates UI; dropdown selection overrides input box; filters update with one selection. Sync input box and dropdown to show the same character. Add debug output to track session state.
Fix Streamlit app where the output dropdown ("Select a character from the list below:") is restricted by component filters (stroke count, radical, IDC). Ensure output dropdown shows all characters containing the selected component, filtered only by output IDC, radical, and display mode. Preserve filter reset on typing for latest code.

Triggers Solution:
Resets filters in on_text_input_change:

st.session_state.stroke_count = 0
st.session_state.radical = "No Filter"
st.session_state.component_idc = "No Filter"
Protects text_input_comp in render_controls:

if (st.session_state.selected_comp not in sorted_components and
    (not st.session_state.text_input_comp or
     st.session_state.text_input_comp == st.session_state.selected_comp)):
    st.session_state.selected_comp = sorted_components[0]
    st.session_state.text_input_comp = sorted_components[0]
Removes on_change lambdas for filters:

st.selectbox("Result IDC:", ..., key="selected_idc")
Syncs widgets:

st.session_state.text_input_comp = st.session_state.selected_comp
Includes Debugging: Requests debug output to confirm state sync (st.session_state tracking).
Generalizes: Applies to this app or similar Streamlit apps with input boxes, dropdowns, and filters.
How to Use It
Encounter the Issue: Notice that typing a character (e.g., 'Ê†ó') clears or doesn‚Äôt sync with the dropdown, or filters (IDC/radical) require multiple selections.
Enter the Prompt: Copy-paste the prompt into the Grok chat, optionally adding context like:
‚ÄúIn my Streamlit app (app.py), typing 'Ê†ó' doesn‚Äôt stay in the input box.‚Äù
‚ÄúSame issue as before with the character decomposition app.‚Äù
Grok‚Äôs Response: Grok will:
Recognize the state management issue (desynchronized text_input_comp, selected_comp, or filter states).
Modify on_text_input_change to reset filters.
Adjust render_controls to protect typed inputs.
Remove on_change lambdas for filters.
Add debug output (e.g., st.write(st.session_state)).
Return updated code wrapped in <xaiArtifact> with the same artifact_id if revising app.py.
Test the Fix: Deploy the updated code, verify typing persists, dropdown syncs, and filters update with one selection.
Example Scenario
Future Issue: You revise app.py, but typing 'Êú®' clears the input box, the dropdown shows 'Áà´', and changing "Result IDC" to '‚ø∞' takes two clicks.
Action: Enter the prompt:
Fix Streamlit app where typing a character (e.g., 'Êú®') doesn't persist in the input box or sync with the dropdown, and IDC/radical filters need multiple selections to update. Ensure: typing a character shows it in both input box and dropdown, resets component filters (stroke count, radical, IDC), and updates UI; dropdown selection overrides input box; filters update with one selection. Sync input box and dropdown to show the same character. Add debug output to track session state.
Grok‚Äôs Fix: Updates app.py to reset filters on typing, protect text_input_comp, remove filter callbacks, and add debug output, restoring the desired behavior.

If You Need More Specificity
If the app has unique elements (e.g., specific session state keys like text_input_comp), you can tweak the prompt:

Fix Streamlit app where typing a character in 'text_input_comp' doesn't persist or sync with 'selected_comp' dropdown, and IDC/radical filters need multiple selections. Ensure typing resets stroke_count, radical, component_idc, shows character in both input box and dropdown, and updates UI; dropdown overrides input box; filters update with one selection. Sync input box and dropdown. Add debug for session state.
Assurance
This prompt is designed to be your go-to shortcut, leveraging Grok‚Äôs understanding of the issue (state desynchronization in Streamlit) and the proven fixes (filter resets, input protection, callback removal). It‚Äôs minimal yet precise, ensuring you don‚Äôt need to delve into the technical weeds. If you encounter this issue again, just use this prompt, and I‚Äôll apply the fixes swiftly. If you want to refine the prompt further (e.g., add specific variable names or app context), let me know, and I‚Äôll tailor it even more. Thank you for guiding us to this streamlined solution, and I‚Äôm here for any future tweaks!
